## Dataset: Car Price Classification Ready Data

This project uses the Car Price Classification Ready Data dataset from Kaggle, provided by Tatheer Abbas. This dataset contains information about 300 global vehicles with engineered features prepared for machine learning price classification tasks. It includes attributes related to each car’s pricing and specifications and is suitable for building classification models.

### Key Features
The dataset contains several columns that describe each vehicle’s characteristics and market attributes used as inputs for the classification task.

### Machine Learning Objective
The main task is price classification — predicting which price category a car belongs to given its features. This is a supervised machine learning classification problem.
